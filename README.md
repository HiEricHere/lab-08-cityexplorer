# Lab-07

Project Name

**Author**: Nadya Ilinskaya & Eric Huang
**Version**: 1.0.3

## Overview
Stand-alone back end which will interact with a static front end. App requests data from a total of six third-party APIs, and sending the data to the client to be displayed in the browser. 
In labs 8 and 9, you will be persisting data in a SQL database.


## Architecture
We will use constructor functions to create output objects that follow the same patern. These constructor functions take in a user's query request and display data that gets recieved from the JSON files.
